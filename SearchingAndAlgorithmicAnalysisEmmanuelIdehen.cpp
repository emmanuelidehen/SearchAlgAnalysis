 problem:
 search for 39 in the list of intergers in the array below. what are the number of comparisons made on each search
 algorithm.
 
 Analysis
 
 Binary search:    n element, n/2 element, n/4 element ...... run time : 0(log2n)
 
 didvide the array(list) by 2 and compare the middle element with the key.
 since it's grater than the key, looks to the right half of the list
 divide the half by 2 and check if the middle is equal to the key
 divide the half into another half of 2 and check if the middle is = to the key.
 
 
 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 13, 24, 25, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 39, 43, 45, 47, 51, 52, 53, 57, 59, 61
 
 33, 37, 38, 39, 43, 45, 47, 51, 52, 53, 57, 59, 61
 
 33, 37, 38, 39, 43, 45
 
 37, 38, 39 , 43
 
 39
 
 
 comaparisons made: 4
 
 
 
 
 Linear search : search through the list comparing one element at a time ...... run time : Big 0(n)
 
 comapare the key with first element, compare with secone element, continue till value entered equal key
 
 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 13, 24, 25, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 39.
 
 Comparisons made: 17
